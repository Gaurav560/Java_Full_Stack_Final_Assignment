key points on constructor: 

it is just a special method to initialize objects 
the name of constructor is same of class 
it is automatically called when object is created
Every time an object is created using the new keyword ,at least one constructor is called.
Constructor does not have any return type .
Constructor are called only once ,when an object is created 
the first line of constructor is a call to super() or this()
super ()-used to call the immediate parent class constructor ,method and instance variable
this()-used to call the current class constructor .used in constructor chaining 
once the constructor is declared private ,it can't be accessed from outside the class 
private keyword is used to stop making objects from outside the class 

three types of constructor:

zero arguments constructor
having zero arguments 

parameterized constructor
having some arguments as parameters

default constructor
when we don't define any constructor , then it is auto created by compiler .
